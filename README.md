Hello dear friends. This is the original public repository for the fully open source EncryptVault program 7-9-2023. "Safely, digitally, store all your crypto wallet seed phrases and private keys." Here is a link to the website: https://EncryptVault.io This version is about midway of 26 versions of the program I have saved. Please be patient, 2 years ago I was not a programmer, I am still not.

Back story: About three years ago, I fell in love with the dream of cryptocurrency. A dream of financial autonomy, the freedom of self-custody (self-banking), freedom of association, and the self-ownership of one's own identity.

Navigating cryptocurrency purchasing and storage was an enormous learning curve for a non-technical layperson such as I was at the time. Within a few short months I had accumulated nearly 20 cryptocurrency wallets. It quickly became apparent to me the enormous complications, level of technical difficulty, and the dangers associated with trying to store the seed phrases for all those wallets. I believed there had to be a better way and I began to form an idea for a protocol and hardware device system which would greatly reduce, both the complexity, and risk of self-custody.

Not only would it make it safer and easier to handle cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases and private keys, but it is likely that it will improve public sentiment and trust in cryptocurrency, fostering unprecedented adoption. In 2017, a financial company called FIS was the first institution to allow crypto payments with credit cards, ushering in the largest crypto bull run in history. I believe that if we can pull off what I am trying to do here, we can beat that bull run.

For these past three years, I have been developing EncryptVault, a protocol and hardware device system to greatly reduce some of the most prevalent hurdles and dangers associated with cryptocurrency wallet seed phrase and private key storage and protection. I have dedicated my life to cryptocurrency and blockchain. I have had thousands of hours of study, I am currently earning my BA in Computer Science, and I own a cryptocurrency news aggregation site called Crypto Financial World: https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-santi/ https://www.linkedin.com/company/cryptofinancialworld/

Mlabs https://mlabs.city/team has agreed to assist us with the production of my EncryptVault system if we could get the finding.

EncryptVault has two possible tracks, or a combination of the two.

Fast, but expensive track: • Mlabs https://mlabs.city/ , has agreed (in writing without signature), to a tiered build-out of the EncryptVault system (contingent upon my ability to raise the necessary funding. Phase I of the build-out would be scientific whitepapers with market analysis and professional peripherals for investors. • Afissio https://www.afissio.com/ , has agreed to create the corporation, the corporate structure, legal safeguards, as well as investment structure (shares for investment). They would also provide many initial legal service and counsel. • The cost for these two separate services is estimated to be approximately $50,000.00/USD with a 10% margin for overages and unforeseen costs.

Slower, but more cost effective track:We build out EncryptVault here and then begin working on the harware aspect of the company.

There is another side to this idea. I am also tackling self identity with Ai assistance as the gate keeper of a sort of "Soul-Token" It's a multifactor authorization protocol which will be an API that will use a variety of identity items to determine a minimum threshold of is it you. The name of this company will be ItsMeAi, the URL will be itsmeai.io (I already have the URL) Join me on this fantastic journey, at worst we end up with a cool alternative way to store our crypto wallet seed phrases, at best, we change the world and make some money. I have a lot of debt, and I would sure like to start fresh. Want to be a part of the company? Let me know. You know how to get funding? Let me know. Welcome.
