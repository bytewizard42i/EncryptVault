# encryptvault_ver_P-1A
Hello dear friends. This is the public repository for the EncryptVault program. "Safely, digitally, store all your crypto wallet seed phrases and private keys." https://EncryptVault.io This version is about midway of 26 versions of the program I have saved. Please be patient, 2 years ago I was not a programmer, I am still not a programmer.
